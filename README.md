# Speed Typing
I wanted to practise handling the DOM, so I tried making a live type-checker. 

It looks like this: 

![Image](/img/example.png)

## How to use
1. Press Start
2. Write the quote you're seeing above the textbox, in the textbox.
3. If you do any mistakes the quote will show you where, and you have to adjust before you're able to finish. ![image2](/img/detect_errors.png)
4. Once completed your accuracy and speed will show, with a option to go a again.![again](/img/speed-typing.png)


Not sure if Im going to do anything more on this one. If you want to check it out, go here [Speed Typing](https://sockulags.github.io/Speed_Typing)
